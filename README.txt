Explanation: 
In the inputs for simulating elections, there is a field called resolution. If you put n, the size of each "centre of opinion" will be n x n. So if you put 1 (which is the default) you get the best resolution. 

Note: The simulations will appear at the buttom of the page after you you click on "Get the simulation"


Note: The website is responsive with respect to the size of the window. If the screen is big enough all the graphs will be inline,
      if it's medium sized the 4 graphs will be in 2 rows on top of each other
      if the screen is small, the graphs will be vertical
